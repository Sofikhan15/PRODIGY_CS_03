# PRODIGY_CS_03

This Python script checks the strength of a password based on standard security guidelines. It evaluates whether a password meets specific criteria to be considered strong.

How It Works:
The script validates the password against the following rules:

Minimum Length: Password must be at least 8 characters long.
Uppercase Letters: Must include at least one uppercase letter.
Lowercase Letters: Must include at least one lowercase letter.
Digits: Must contain at least one numeric digit.
Special Characters: Must have at least one special character from the set !@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>.
Usage:
Run the script and input a password when prompted. The script will evaluate the password and provide feedback, indicating if it's strong or highlighting which criteria are not met.

This tool serves as a simple utility to guide users in creating more secure passwords by following common password strength guidelines.
